As a media artist, designer and spatial thinker, I am intrigued by the ways in which the transformation of the subject of contemporary culture requires rethinking of the new aesthetic, technique and dynamic perception of space. I build my works on the nomadic subject’s reaction to and interactions with unconventional spatial orientations with data and machine intelligence. Embedding media arts into architecture, I question the possibility of a post digital architectural future in which there are no more non-digital realities. I invite the viewers to visualize alternative realities by presenting them the possibility of re-defining the functionalities of both interior and exterior architectural formations. My work suggests that all spaces and facades have potentials to be utilized as the media artists’ canvases. Privileging difference rather than singularity and movement rather than stasis, I face all the new challenges that the gradual development of an enriched immersive environment and ubiquitous computing impose on architects, media artists and engineers. How is our experience of space changing, now that digital objects ranging from smart phones to urban screens have all but colonized our everyday lives? How have media technologies changed our conceptualizations of space, and how has architecture embraced these shifting conceptualizations? These are the three main questions that I tackle by not simply integrating media into built forms, but by translating the logic of a new media technology into spatial design.
