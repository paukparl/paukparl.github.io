I'm a mission-driven experience designer, interested in creating physical and digital experience through user-centered design. I have range of experience from international corporate projects to start-up development, as well as in-depth user research and design strategy. As an experience designer, my goal is to design and build experience that is relevant and meaningful whether it is physical or digital. A better experience starts with understanding problem, constraints, and objectives and ends with design derived from solid reasoning with creativity. I care about the details and consider the user-centered process to be crucial in creating intuitive yet effective design. I consider prototyping to be my weapon of choice in thinking through user's experience with design and new possibilities. Thank you for stopping by.
